## Introduction
Cardiac arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats that can lead to severe health complications, including stroke and heart failure. Accurate classification of arrhythmias is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning to improve arrhythmia detection and classification.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust classification system for cardiac arrhythmias.
- Improve accuracy and reliability over existing methods.
- Validate the system using a diverse set of ECG data.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for clinicians to use in real-time diagnosis.

## Proposed Architecture
The system comprises the following key components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Noise removal and normalization of ECG signals.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features using advanced signal processing techniques like wavelet transforms.
3. **Classification**: Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on labeled ECG data.
4. **Validation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Plan of Action
### **Month 1: Preparation**
- Weeks 1-2: Conduct literature review and identify research gaps.
- Weeks 3-4: Acquire and prepare ECG datasets.

### **Month 2: Development**
